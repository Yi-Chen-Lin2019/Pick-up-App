# Pick-up-App
This is the 3rd semester project we have in computer science program in UCN.


## Mission 
Our project concerns a need that has been on the rise lately due to the pandemic, and that is contactless shopping. We aim to help shoppers stay safe, minimize contact with others, including the retail personnel, speed up their shopping and decrease the chances of forgetting something. Our solution will be a universal solution for stores that want to introduce contact-free shopping, where customers shop from the comfort of their own homes and pick up at the desk of stores. 

## Technologies 
Our whole project is built on .NET Framework with Visual Studio IDE.
